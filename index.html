<h2>Let me tell you a story</h2>
<p class="story-lead">
I’m a man with a loving wife and two dogs. Every day we wake up and work—8, 10, sometimes 12 hours. We come home exhausted, only to spend the money we earned on food to give us energy to do it again. We pay for a place to sleep so we can wake up and do it all over.
</p>
<p>
We save every penny hoping one day it will be enough. We dream of raising kids, but even that feels out of reach when we’re barely keeping up.
</p>
<p>
Have you ever wondered why life feels like this? Why we struggle every day, only to struggle again tomorrow?
</p>
<p>
Now imagine something different. A place where the cycle ends — where food, shelter, and health are provided by the community. A place where you raise your family, follow your passions, and finally breathe.
</p>
<p class="invitation">
We’re building that place. We’re building a town of hard-working people who want one thing: a life free of constant financial strain. We invite you to watch our journey and join the conversation.
